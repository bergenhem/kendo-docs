# Tutorial: Kendo Music Store: Introduction

In this tutorial, we will review portions of the **Kendo Music Store** sample project.

The Music Store sample is split into three seperate projects; Web, Dashboard and Mobile.

# Kendo Music Store Web

This sample project was based on Microsoft's [MVC Music Store](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/), so much of the
server-side processing and the data structure are reused in this project.
The UI of the music store was completely redesigned with Kendo UI.
It focuses on [Kendo UI Web](http://www.kendoui.com/web.aspx), how it was used and the ways in which it interacts with ASP.NET MVC, WebAPI and WCF Data Services.
